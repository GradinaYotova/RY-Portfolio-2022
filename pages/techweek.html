      <p class="info">OpenRNDR was one week workshop during Tech Week (annual program from the Graphic Design Department in the Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague).  <br> It was exploring machine learning models and how to use them in creative ways. They introduced us to softwares, which are simplified versions of pre-trained machine learning models. <br> For the final outcome I created real-time installation. Using web cam the installation was tracking people and objects, and finding similar compositions to fill in the other half of the screen. It was exhibited in the gallery of the Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague.
