      <p class="info">The Like Mechanism 
        The main mechanism of photo interaction on Instagram <br>(and to a lesser extent Facebook) is the posting of photographs and the viewing of those photographs by others. Over and above the photographs, however, these social networking sites allow users to comment on and like photos, but also to link to other users in those comments or to insert. Hashtags that can “topicalise” photographs. Much of the interaction online on social networking sites takes place through these relatively lightweight mechanisms.<br>
       <br>
        Online Discussions Online photo-sharing sites such as Instagram and Flickr also over mechanisms for discussions with the makers of the photo and their broader social network through comments. Comments were initially designed to enable users to provide feedback on the content presented.<br>
        <br>
        Screens and digital surfaces appear to have their own affordances that support new and potentially more interesting behaviours. Perhaps the most important aspect of the phone is that it is always available and can be pulled out spontaneously in conversation. This means that photographs can be brought into conversation opportunistically, rather than. Premeditated ‘photo event.’ Indeed, many of the online interactions we documented would have been impossible with physical photos.
