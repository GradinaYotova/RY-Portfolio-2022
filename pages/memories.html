      <p class="info">Physicality of Memories is a project inspired by the concept about the cabinets of curiosity.
        By placing objects side by side collectors were trying to organise the world and understand it more deeply. Where they came from and what is valuable to them.<br>
        Physicality of Memories is spatial video installation re-creating a single flow of a nostalgic thoughts about my early childhood memories.
